   Welcome 👋

Hi, my name is Harishan. On my this page you will see all my different projects I have worked on, from things like school projects, personal projects, and freelance projects. I also really like editing videos, which can be found on my Youtube channel. This Github account is really so that I stay consistent with building and coding, which I think is very important.
