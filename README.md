<h3 align="center">about me</h3>


<div align="center">
   
   Hi, my name is Harishan. On my this page you will see all my different projects I have worked on, from things like     school projects, personal projects, and freelance projects. I also really like editing videos, which can be found 
   on my Youtube channel. This Github account is really so that I stay consistent with building and coding, which I 
   think is very important.
